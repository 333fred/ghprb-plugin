This plugin builds pull requests in github and report results.

When new pull request occures in project and author of the pull
request isn't whitelisted, builder will ask "Can one of the
admins verify this patch?" and one of the admins must add the
author to whitelist with comment "this is ok to test".

If author of the pull request is whitelisted adding new pull
request or new commit to existing pull request will start new
rebuild.

New rebuild can be started also with comment "retest this please".
